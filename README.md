# rp-bot
just a little project, to help make rp'ing more immersive on discord

# usage guide
first thing you want to do, is to go to the channel you want to make available to the bot and write #@setup

then, to chreate a character you write #@addchar [character] [beginning of text] [end of text]

after that you can just write whatever you want surrounded by [beginning of text] and [end of text]
